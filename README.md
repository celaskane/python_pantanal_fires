# python_pantanal_fires

Jupyter project developed with Python using some libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GeoPandas and Plotly Express. 
This project aims to perform a data analysis of Pantanal, a helpless bioma of the midwestern region of Brazil that have been suffering with the constant fires that destroys the local fauna and flora.
The data was acquired from Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE (available in: https://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/bdqueimadas/#).
I've been developing that project as a undergraduate research at Faculdade de Tecnologia do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo - FATEC.
