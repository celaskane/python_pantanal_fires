# python_pantanal_fires

Jupyter project developed with Python using some libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GeoPandas and Plotly Express. 
This project aims to perform a data analysis of Pantanal, a helpless biome of the midwestern region of Brazil that have been suffering with the constant fires that destroys the local fauna and flora.
The data was acquired from Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE (available in: https://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/bdqueimadas/#).
I've been developing this project as an undergraduate research of my graduation course at Faculdade de Tecnologia do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo - FATEC.
